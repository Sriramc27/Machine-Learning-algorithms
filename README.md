# Explainable Machine Learning In Identifying Sample-Specific and Class-Specific Features

This project uses the MNIST dataset and has three sections: Understanding Data, Classification Using XGBoost, and Explanation of Predicted Results Using SHAP

Machine Learning algorithms utilized:-
1.	Principal Component Analysis
2.	T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
3.	K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
4.	Logistic regression
5.	Support vector machine (SVM)
6.	Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
7.	Decision Tree
8.	Random Forest
9.	Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
